1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

A)  The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities likely represents a one-to-many relationship,
    where one product belongs to one category, but a category can have multiple products associated with it.
   
   Product Entity: Each row in the "Product" table represents a distinct product. Within the "Product" table,
                   there is an attribute called "category_id" which serves as a foreign key referencing the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table.

   Product_Category Entity: Each row in the "Product_Category" table represents a distinct category for products.
                           The "id" attribute in the "Product_Category" table acts as the primary key, uniquely identifying each category. 
                           When a product is associated with a category, 
                           its "category_id" attribute in the "Product" table matches the "id" attribute of the corresponding category in the "Product_Category" table.

  for each product in the "Product" table, there is a reference to a category in the "Product_Category" table through the "category_id" foreign key.
  This allows you to easily categorize and organize products based on their respective categories.


2.How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
A)  to ensure that we can do these steps 
Database Constraint: We ensure that every product in the "Product" table has a valid category by setting up a rule in the database. 
                     This rule ensures that the value entered into the "category_id" column must exist as a category in the "Product_Category" table.

Implementation with SQL: We use SQL commands to implement this rule.
                         For example, we can use the `ALTER TABLE` statement to add a foreign key constraint that links the "category_id" column in the "Product" table to the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table.

Application Validation: Additionally, we can validate inputs in our application to double-check that the category assigned to a product exists in the "Product_Category" table before saving it to the database.
                        This way, we catch any errors before they affect the database.

By combining these two approaches, we ensure that our database maintains data integrity, and every product is associated with a valid category. This practice is crucial for the accuracy and reliability of our data.
